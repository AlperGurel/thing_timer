# Track Your Time On Projects In The Simplest Way

I like to know how much time I spent on certain projects. 
The idea comes from Steam Client where you can see how much time you have spent on a game.

There are a lot of apps that can help you do this with your project, but the ones I find are distant from the simplicity I seek.
I only want to keep the time of the project. Plus adding notes(issues) to the project so I can keep track of the last thing I do about the project.
Those notes are very primitive commits, when I think of it now.

The app main route consist of all the projects you started, giving details about project start time and total hours spent until now.

I start the timer when I work on a project, and stop it when I am done. It is easy to use, easy to develop.
Below you can see, I continued "Ä°kon Sosyal Medya" project and it has been 2 seconds since I started the timer. 
That way I know how much time I spent in the current session.

The detail window shows the same details as listview, plus the notes I have taken for the project.

I can add new notes whether the timer continous or not.
